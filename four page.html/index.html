        The capital cost of implementing BRT is lower than for light rail: A study by the U.S. Government Accountability
        Office (GAO) from 2000 found that the average capital cost per mile for busways was $13.5 million while light
        rail average cost was $34.8 million.[81] The total investment varies considerably due to factors such as cost of
        the roadway, amount of grade separation, station structures and traffic signal systems.

        In the year 2003 a study edited by the German GTZ compared various MRT systems all over the world and concluded
        ″Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) can provide high-quality, metro-like transit service at a fraction of the cost of other
        options″.[82]

        In the year 2013 the analysis of a database of nineteen LRT projects, twenty-six HRT projects, and forty-two BRT
        projects specified „In higher income countries ... an HRT alternative is likely to cost up to 40 times as much
        as a BRT alternative".[83] and a surface LRT alternative about 4 times that of a BRT alternative.

        Operational cost of running a BRT system is generally lower than light rail, though the exact comparison varies,
        and labor costs depend heavily on wages, which vary between countries. For the same level of ridership and
        demand, higher labor costs in the developed world relative to developing countries will tend to encourage
        developed world transit operators to prefer operate services with larger but less frequent vehicles. This will
        allow the service to achieve the same capacity while minimizing the number of drivers. This may come as a hidden
        cost to passengers in lower demand routes who experience significantly lower frequencies and longer waiting
        times and limit gain of ridership.

        In the study done by the U.S. GAO, BRT systems usually had lower cost as well based on "operating cost per
        vehicle hour", as on "operating cost per revenue mile", and on "operating cost per passenger trip", mainly
        because of lower vehicle cost and lower infrastructure cost.[81]

        An ambitious light rail system runs partly grade separated (e.g. underground), which gives free right-of-way and
        much faster traffic compared to passing the traffic signals needed in a surface level system. Underground BRT
        was suggested as early as 1954.[84] As long as most buses still run on diesel, air quality can become a
        significant concern in tunnels, but the Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel is an example of using hybrid buses,
        which switch to overhead electric propulsion while they are underground, eliminating diesel emissions and
        reducing fuel usage. Alternatives are elevated busways or - more expensive - elevated railways
