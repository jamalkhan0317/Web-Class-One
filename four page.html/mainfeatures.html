        Bus-only lanes make for faster travel and ensure that buses are not delayed by mixed traffic congestion. A
        median alignment bus-only keeps buses away from busy curb-side side conflicts, where cars and trucks are
        parking, standing and turning. Separate rights of way may be used such as the completely elevated Xiamen BRT.
        Transit malls or 'bus streets' may also be created in city centers.

        Fare prepayment at the station, instead of on board the bus, eliminates the delay caused by passengers paying on
        board. Use of a payment card which must be touched briefly to a card-reader is also fast.

        For the system to work, users can receive "credit" on the electronic cards: in this manner, passengers who have
        no money left on the cards can take the bus at sidewalk stops where there is no possibility to recharge these
        cards. This means that the balance in the card can be negative, up to two ticket fares, so passengers can take
        the bus in the street and recharge the card once they reach a main line station. As the card itself costs more
        than the maximum negative balance, the passenger has no incentive to default on negative credit.[25]
        Transmilenio in Bogot√° followed suit in 2014 also creating routes that can use main line stations and regular
        sidewalk stations,[26] but instead of giving credit to passengers to allow boarding the bus on sidewalks,
        published a map readable in smart phones giving the location of a dense[27] network of 4,000 recharging points,
        located in internet cafes and other business, that use a swipe-card terminal for recharging. This system has the
        additional benefit of diminishing queues on main line stations

    <p>
        Prohibiting turns for traffic across the bus lane significantly reduces delays to the buses. Bus priority will
        often be provided at signalized intersections to reduce delays by extending the green phase or reducing the red
        phase in the required direction compared to the normal sequence. Prohibiting turns may be the most important
        measure for moving buses through intersections.
