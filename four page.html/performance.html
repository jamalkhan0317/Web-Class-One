    <p>A BRT system can be measured by a number of factors. The BRT Standard was developed by the Institute for
        Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP) to score BRT corridors, producing a list of rated BRT corridors
        meeting the minimum definition of BRT. The highest rated systems received a "gold" ranking. The latest edition
        of the standard was published in 2016.[42]

        Other metrics used to evaluate BRT performance include:

        The vehicle headway is the average time interval between vehicles on the same line. Buses can operate at
        headways of 10 seconds or less, but average headways on TransMilenio at busy intersections are 13 seconds,[43]
        14 seconds for the busiest section of the Metrobus (Istanbul), 7 seconds in Belo Horizonte,[44] 6 seconds in Rio
        de Janeiro.[45]
        Vehicle capacity, which can range from 50 passengers for a conventional bus up to some 300 for a bi-articulated
        vehicle or 500.[46][2]
        The effectiveness of the stations to handle passenger demand. High volumes of passengers on vehicles require
        large bus stations and more boarding areas at busy interchange points. This is the standard bottleneck of BRT
        (and HRT).[47]
        The effectiveness of the feeder system: can these deliver people to stations at the required speed?
        Local passenger demand. Without enough local demand for travel, the capacity will not be used.
        Based on this data, the minimum headway and maximum current vehicle capacities, the theoretical maximum
        throughput measured in passengers per hour per direction (PPHPD) for a single traffic lane is some 150,000
        passengers per hour (250 passengers per vehicle, one vehicle every 6 seconds). In real world conditions BRT Rio
        (de Janeiro, BRS Presidente Vargas) with 65.000 PPHPD holds the record, TransMilenio Bogotá and Metrobus
        Istanbul perform 49,000 – 45,000 PPHPD, most other busy systems operating in the 15,000 to 25,000 range.</p>
